2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and preparing data for model training.
   - Applying one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

3. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Building models using:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor

4. **Model Validation**
   - Performing 3-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

5. **Model Fine-Tuning**
   - Hyperparameter optimization using:
     - Grid Search
     - Random Search

6. **Performance Testing**
   - Evaluating the final model's accuracy and reliability.

7. **Simulation**
   - Predicting energy consumption using Python simulations.
